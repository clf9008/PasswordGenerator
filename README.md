### Project Goal

The goal of this repository is to create a webpage that allows users to generate a random password that includes special characters, numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and allows them to chose the length of the password. The password can be anywhere from 8 to 128 characters long.

### Development

The project took a little over four days and ran into several bugs getting the correct array to work in the gettingRandomCharacters function. The project is up and working, however, can use improvements visually and a better randomizing character function.
